This code is a Python script that uses the Telebot library to create a Telegram bot that registers users and stores their information in an SQLite database.

The bot is created using a token provided by Telegram, which is used to authenticate the bot with the Telegram API. When the bot receives the '/start' command from a user, it creates a new table in the SQLite database (if it doesn't exist already) and prompts the user to enter their name.
